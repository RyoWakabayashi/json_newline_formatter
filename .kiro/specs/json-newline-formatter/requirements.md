# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements a VSCode extension that enhances the editing experience for JSON files containing escaped newline characters (`\n`). The extension will automatically display these escape sequences as actual line breaks in the editor while preserving the ability to edit the content seamlessly. This improves readability of JSON files with multi-line string content without modifying the underlying file structure.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer working with JSON files, I want to see `\n` escape sequences displayed as actual line breaks in string values, so that I can easily read multi-line content without having to mentally parse escape sequences.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a JSON file is opened in VSCode THEN the extension SHALL detect string values containing `\n` escape sequences
2. WHEN string values contain `\n` escape sequences THEN the extension SHALL render them as visual line breaks in the editor
3. WHEN the file is displayed THEN the original JSON structure SHALL remain intact (quotes, commas, braces)
4. WHEN viewing the formatted content THEN syntax highlighting SHALL continue to work correctly

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer editing JSON files, I want to edit the visually formatted content directly, so that I can modify multi-line strings naturally without manually inserting escape sequences.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I click in a formatted string area THEN the cursor SHALL position correctly within the logical string content
2. WHEN I type new content including pressing Enter THEN new lines SHALL be automatically converted to `\n` escape sequences in the underlying file
3. WHEN I delete content across line breaks THEN the corresponding `\n` escape sequences SHALL be removed from the underlying file
4. WHEN I save the file THEN the saved content SHALL contain proper `\n` escape sequences maintaining valid JSON format

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the extension to work seamlessly with existing VSCode features, so that my normal workflow is not disrupted.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using Find/Replace functionality THEN it SHALL work correctly with both the visual content and underlying escape sequences
2. WHEN using code folding THEN JSON structure folding SHALL continue to work normally
3. WHEN using auto-completion THEN JSON schema validation and suggestions SHALL remain functional
4. WHEN copying content THEN it SHALL copy the visual format but paste as proper JSON with escape sequences

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to be able to toggle this formatting feature on and off, so that I can choose when to use enhanced display versus raw JSON view.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the extension is active THEN there SHALL be a command to toggle the formatting display
2. WHEN formatting is disabled THEN the file SHALL display raw JSON with visible `\n` escape sequences
3. WHEN formatting is enabled THEN the file SHALL display with visual line breaks
4. WHEN toggling between modes THEN the cursor position SHALL be preserved appropriately

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the extension to handle edge cases gracefully, so that it works reliably with various JSON structures.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN JSON contains nested objects with string values THEN formatting SHALL apply to all applicable string values
2. WHEN JSON contains arrays of strings THEN formatting SHALL apply to each string element containing `\n`
3. WHEN JSON is malformed THEN the extension SHALL not break VSCode functionality
4. WHEN string values contain other escape sequences (like `\t`, `\"`) THEN they SHALL be preserved and displayed correctly alongside `\n` formatting
